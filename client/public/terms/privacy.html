                            <h5 class="font-weight-light text-blue">Cookies</h5>
                            <p>We use cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to identify whether you
                                have logged in and recognize that your web browser has accessed our servers before. Some
                                third-party services that we use may place their own identifiers in your browser. This
                                Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and not the use of cookies by third
                                parties.</p>

                            <h5 class="font-weight-light text-blue">Do Not Track</h5>
                            <p>Some browsers make it possible for you to signal that you don’t want your Internet
                                browsing activity to be tracked. The Internet community hasn’t reached a consensus on
                                how to best honor these signals, so devxop.com doesn’t respond to Do Not Track requests
                                at this time.</p>

                            <h5 class="font-weight-light text-blue">Email</h5>

                            <h5 class="font-weight-light text-blue">A special note about Google Analytics</h5>
                            <p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.
                                Google Analytics uses cookies to help the website analyze how users use the site. The
                                information generated by the cookie about your use of the website will be transmitted to
                                and stored by Google on servers in the United States. In case IP anonymisation is
                                activated on this website, your IP address will be truncated within the area of Member

                                Google server in the USA and truncated there. IP anonymisation is active on this

                            <p>Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website for the
                                purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for
                                website operators and providing them other services relating to website activity and
                                internet usage. The IP address that your browser conveys within the scope of Google
                                Analytics will not be associated with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the
                                use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please

                                your current web browser.</p>
                            <h4 class="font-weight-light text-blue">Data Security</h4>
                            <p>devxop.com is designed to have several layers of security.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) to create a secure
                                    tunnel to protect data in transit between your device and devxop.com’s servers.</li>
                                <li>We don’t retain your actual account password, but hash and salt it to help protect
                                    it against possible compromise.</li>
                                <li>We narrowly limit the number of employees who have access to user data through

                            <p>No transmission over the internet is completely secure, so we cannot absolutely guarantee
