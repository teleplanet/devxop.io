                        <p>When deleting your account, whether as a single user or as an organization, any personally
                            identifiable information we have about you will be deleted within 90 days. Content that
                            you’ve contributed to devxop.com through the form of groups will still be available to

                            your account, though your identity will be anonymized. Other users will still be able to

                        <h4 class="font-weight-light text-blue">Limitation of Liability</h4>
                        <em>To the fullest extent allowed by law, devxop.com shall not be liable for any indirect,
                            incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, any loss of profits or revenues, or
                            any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from (A) your access
                            to, use of, inability to access, or inability to use devxop.com; (B) any third-party conduct
                            or content on devxop.com, including any defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of third
                            parties; or (C) any unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your content.</em>
                        <p>(Some countries or states may not allow these limitations, so this provision might not apply
                            to you.)</p>

                        <h4 class="font-weight-light text-blue">Arbitration and Opt Out</h4>
                        <p>We’d like to resolve any disputes fairly and quickly. Toward that end, if you have any issue
                            with devxop.com, please contact us and we’ll work with you in good faith to try to resolve
                            the matter. If we can’t resolve the dispute informally, you and devxop.com agree to resolve
                            any claim against each other through final and binding arbitration.</p>

                        <h4 class="font-weight-light text-blue">Your Right to Opt Out of Arbitration</h4>
                        <p>You may opt out of the agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor devxop.com can
                            require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify
                            devxop.com within 90 days of the date that you first agreed to these Terms.</p>
                        <p><em>Your written opt-out notice must include (1) your name and residence address; (2) the
                                email address associated with your account; (3) a clear statement that you want to opt
                                out of this arbitration agreement; and (4) your signature. To opt out of arbitration,
                                please send an email to <a href="mailto:law@devxop.com">law@devxop.com</a>.</em></p>

                        <h4 class="font-weight-light text-blue">Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h4>
                        <p>These Terms will be governed by the Portuguese laws, except for its conflict of laws
                            principles.</p>

                        <h4 class="font-weight-light text-blue">Entire Agreement and Severability</h4>
                        <p>The Terms, and the other materials incorporated by reference, constitute the full and entire
                            agreement between you and devxop.com. If any provision of these Terms is found to be
                            unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="font-weight-light text-blue">No Waiver</h4>
                        <p>No waiver of any provision of these Terms shall be a further or continuing waiver of that
                            term. devxop.com’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms does not
                            constitute a waiver of that right or provision.</p>

                        <h4 class="font-weight-light text-blue">Modification</h4>
                        <p>The Terms may be modified from time to time. If we make changes that we believe will
                            substantially alter your rights, we will notify you in advance. You’ll agree to accept any
                            changes or revisions to the Terms by continuing to use devxop.com.</p>

                        <h4 class="font-weight-light text-blue">Contact</h4>
                        <p>We welcome all questions, concerns, and feedback you might have about these terms. If you
