<!--             <p>Once you've subscribed your user, you'd send their subscription to your
                server to store in a database so that when you want to send a message
                you can lookup the subscription and send a message to it.</p>
            <p>To simplify things for this code lab copy the following details
                into the <a href="https://web-push-codelab.glitch.me/">Push Companion
                    Site</a> and it'll send a push message for you, using the application
                server keys on the site - so make sure they match.</p> -->
